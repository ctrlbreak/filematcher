For current requirements, see `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` (created for next milestone).

---

**Defined:** 2026-01-19
**Core Value:** Safely deduplicate files across directories while preserving the master copy and logging all changes.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. All completed.

### Master Directory

- [x] **MSTR-01**: User can designate one directory as "master" via `--master` flag
- [x] **MSTR-02**: Files in master directory are never modified or deleted
- [x] **MSTR-03**: Tool validates master directory is one of the compared directories

### Dry-Run Preview

- [x] **DRY-01**: User can preview planned changes with `--dry-run` flag
- [x] **DRY-02**: Dry-run shows list of files that would be modified
- [x] **DRY-03**: Dry-run shows what action would be taken on each file
- [x] **DRY-04**: Dry-run shows estimated space savings before execution

### Change Logging

- [x] **LOG-01**: All planned changes are logged with timestamp
- [x] **LOG-02**: Log includes: action type, source file path, target file path
- [x] **LOG-03**: Log file path configurable via `--log` flag

### Summary Statistics

- [x] **STAT-01**: Display count of duplicate groups found
- [x] **STAT-02**: Display count of files that would be affected
- [x] **STAT-03**: Display total space that would be saved/reclaimed

### Safe Defaults

- [x] **SAFE-01**: Preview mode is the default when `--action` is specified
- [x] **SAFE-02**: `--execute` flag enables actual file modifications
- [x] **SAFE-03**: `--dry-run` flag removed (preview is always default without `--execute`)
- [x] **SAFE-04**: Clear messaging when preview mode is active ("use --execute to apply changes")

### Execution Infrastructure

- [x] **EXEC-01**: Support `--action` flag for specifying action type (hardlink, symlink, delete)
- [x] **EXEC-02**: Execution mode runs when `--execute` flag is specified with `--action`
- [x] **EXEC-03**: Execution requires `--master`, `--action`, and `--execute` flags

### Actions

- [x] **ACT-01**: Replace duplicate files with hard links to master
- [x] **ACT-02**: Replace duplicate files with symbolic links to master
- [x] **ACT-03**: Delete duplicate files (keeping master only)
- [x] **ACT-04**: Links preserve original filename (pointing to master file)

### Testing

- [x] **TEST-01**: Unit tests for master directory validation
- [x] **TEST-02**: Unit tests for dry-run output formatting
- [x] **TEST-03**: Unit tests for safe default behavior and --execute flag
- [x] **TEST-04**: Unit tests for change logging
- [x] **TEST-05**: Integration tests for CLI flag combinations

## v2 Requirements (Deferred)

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in v1.1 scope.

### Interactive Mode

- **INT-01**: Interactive mode prompts for confirmation on each change
- **INT-02**: User can approve, skip, or quit during interactive mode
- **INT-03**: "Approve all remaining" option in interactive mode

### Advanced Features

- **ADV-01**: Relative symlinks option for portable links
- **ADV-02**: JSON output format for scripting integration

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Automatic backup creation | User responsibility; adds complexity |
| Multi-directory (3+) master selection | Complexity explosion with unclear priority |
| GUI interface | CLI-focused tool |
| Undo/rollback functionality | Log file serves as record; manual recovery |
| File renaming to match master | Links preserve original names by design |
